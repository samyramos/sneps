This is the recommended template for new SNEPs.

Note that an SNEP number will be assigned by an editor if the author fails to do so or makes a mistake. When opening a pull request to submit your SNEP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, snep-draft_title_abbrev.md.


## 
**Simple Summary**

Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SNEP.


## 
**Abstract**

A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.


## 
**Motivation**

Describing the motivation behind a proposed change is essential for the Core Team as well as the community itself to assess the SNEP. The SNEP needs to clearly state why the existing platform or components of the platform are inadequate to address the problem identified by the author.


## 
**Technical Specification**

The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current SingularityNET platforms.  The SNEP should consider backwards compatibilities and describe if and how the proposal is (in)compatible with any previously implemented features. The SNEP should suggest ways to resolve any incompatibilities.


## 
**Test Cases and Community Discussions**

Test cases for a proposal are highly recommended to help ground the issue and facilitate the SNEP’s validation by the Core Team. All SNEPs would also benefit from, though it is not necessary to do so,  referring to discussions (closed or ongoing) held by the SingularityNET community on the matter. Proving that efforts have been made to expose the community to the proposal or issue raised by the SNEP, and that some levels of consensus have been already reached, would make for a well-grounded SNEP. Sound or popular objections or concerns raised vis-à-vis the SNEP’s content during community discussions should be referenced.  


## 
**Implementation**

The implementations must be completed before any SNEP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the SNEP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.
